# Public Engagement Tool (final project)
​
## Description

Browser-based applications built with JavaScript serve a multitude of functions beyond the mere presentation and exploration of data; while these functionalities are undeniably crucial, they represent only a fraction of its potential applications. One significant application, particularly within the realm of urban planning and design, is constituent engagement.
​
In your story map project you created an explanation of some topic that users could explore. In the previous dashboard project, you created a web application that allowed users to sort through data visually displayed. Through either filter checkboxes, search bars, or something else, you displayed different data and made your web tool interactive.
​
The goal for this project is to go beyond data filtering. You want your web tool to offer **something new** to the user *beyond* a visual display of the data. The user will be able to engage and *add* their input to the web somehow. Let's call this the **engagement component**. The engagement component could be:
- user is able to *add* data (ie add a point to the map)
- user is able to *save notes* about data
- user is able to *manipulate* data (ie change boundaries, move points)
- user is able to choose data to *graph*
- user is able to *run a model* that changes the data (ie click a button that calculates NDVI index)
To ground you in this process, **think of a client or primary user for your web application**. This could be nonprofit looking for funding, a community organizer looking to set up a location, a scientist looking at bird migration patterns. Be creative!
​
In addition, you will **present a 5-minute presentation on your progress on Dec 6** in class. Your presentation does not need to be very fancy but should include:
- a slide introducing your client and how you thought of them
- a slide on the goal of your web application (what need you wish it to fulfill)
- a tour of your web application on the browser
- if applicable, how you wish to improve on your web application
**If you are not able to be in class on Dec 6, let me know ASAP and you will submit a recorded presentation**
​
​
## Requirements
- a map 
- interactive data filters (either build on to dashboard project or create a new repository)
- one engagement component
- submit a pull request for your fork of the repository
- presentation on Dec 6
​
## A note about grading
The above requirements are my strong recommendation for what you should aim to have in your project, but please remember that your grade is not necessarily attached to hitting every point. This project should above all be a demonstration of some of the things you've learned in this course. In this project you should demonstrate that you can empathize with how a user may be engaged to contribute to your website or application. Generally speaking, a recipe for a good demonstration project is one that does fewer things well than one that does a many things simply to check off boxes.
